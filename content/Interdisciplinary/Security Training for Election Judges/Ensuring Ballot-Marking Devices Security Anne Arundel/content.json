However, because potential election day infiltration has continued to become an issue throughout recent years, it is important to ensure that election judges are aware of the potential threats, and how to prevent them from happening. The Ballot Marking Device provides voters with impairments another option to mark their ballots independently. ALL Voters are also encouraged to use this device. Each designated precinct receives a minimum of one ballot marking device, and it is the responsibility of the election judges to set up and monitor the equipment under the supervision of the chief judges. It is also the chief judge’s responsibility to ensure there are five (5) ballots cast from the ballot marking device by 1:00 PM."

The settings on the device can also be adjusted to offer high-contrast and enlarged print viewing options.
