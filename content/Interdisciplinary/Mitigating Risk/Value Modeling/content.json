What we care about is then arranged into a hierarchy, with the values, or cares, referred to as measures.  A hierarchy will show relationships and if any value is dependent on or a subset of another measure.  Hierarchies and the VFT process allow us to organize our thoughts and clearly identify what is important in the decision process.
