One example may be wrting a nonsense letter where the message you really want to send is hidden as the first letters of each sentence. Another example would be transmitting a radio message alongside a song - the latter must be filtered out before the message can be clearly heard. Cryptography is a form of data hiding where the message is converted into a completely different form."

					"text": "In cryptology, a <strong>cipher</strong> is used to convert a readable message (<strong>plaintext</strong>) into an indecipherable form (<strong>ciphertext</strong>). This ciphertext can be safely transmitted without risk of exposing the sensitive information it contains. Ciphers may take additional arguments, collectively referred to as a <strong>key</strong>, to determine how plaintext is converted to and from ciphertext."
