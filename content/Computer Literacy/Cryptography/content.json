As illustrated in the figure, Bob (the sender) wishes to send a secret message to Alice (the recipient). He <strong>encrypts</strong> the plaintext using an encryption algorithm. The encryption process scrambles the plaintext to produce what is known as <strong>ciphertext</strong>. Alice recovers the plaintext using the process of <strong>decryption</strong>. The encryption/decryption algorithm is usually not secret. What makes the ciphertext difficult to decipher is the use of one or more <strong>keys</strong> in the encryption/decryption process. In <strong>secret key</strong> (or <strong>symmetric</strong>) <strong>encryption</strong>, <i>one key</i> is used and is known only to Bob and Alice. In <strong>public key</strong> (or <strong>asymmetric</strong>) <strong>encryption</strong> both Bob and Alice own a <i>pair of unique keys</i>. Each pair consists of a <strong>private key</strong> and a <strong>public key</strong>. The public key is known by the public, but only Bob and Alice know their respective private keys."

However, a unique key called the file encryption key (FEK) is automatically generated every time the user needs to encrypt a file. After encrypting a file, EFS uses the user’s public key to encrypt the FEK. It also encrypts the FEK using the recovery agent’s public key.",
