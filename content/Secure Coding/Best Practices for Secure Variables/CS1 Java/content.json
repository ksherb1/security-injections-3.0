It is much easier (& smarter) to create secure code from design than to try to secure it during coding."

Steps to reduce the cost of system maintenance and the risk of security vulnerabilities need to be adopted by software development organizations. While there are a number of best practices available to address the issue of software security vulnerabilities, these practices are frequently difficult to reuse due to the implementation specific nature of the best practices. In addition, greater understanding of the root causes of security flaws has led to a greater appreciation of the importance of taking security into account in all phases in the software development life cycle, not just in the implementation and deployment phases. Many current best security practices focus on implementation and deployment issues and so do not address security flaws introduced in earlier phases of the development process."

Scope minimization also helps developers avoid common programming errors, improves code readability by connecting the declaration and actual use of a variable, and improves maintainability because unused variables are more easily detected and removed. Therefore, these types of variables should be avoided.",
                        "Constants should be declared as static final and denoted with UPPERCASE CHARACTERS. The static modifier says that the constant is a class variable (the closet we come to a global variable in JAVA). The final modifier tells the program that this variable cannot be changed; therefore, malware cannot change it, making the variable more secure. These types of variables are usually declared private, as well.",
                        "Reuse of identifier names in subscopes leads to obscuration or shadowing. The identifiers in the current scope render those defined elsewhere inaccessible; such ambiguity burdens code maintainers, especially when code requires access to both the original named entity and the inaccessible one. The problem is aggravated when the reused name is defined in a different package. A simple name may occur in contexts where it may potentially be interpreted as the name of a variable, a type, or a package. No identifier should obscure or shadow another identifier in a containing scope. For instance, a local variable should not reuse the name of a class field or method, or the class name or package name. Similarly, an inner class name should not reuse the name of an outer class or package."
