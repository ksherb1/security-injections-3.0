SQL Injections happen when a developer accepts user input that is directly placed into a SQL Statement and doesn’t properly validate and filter out dangerous characters. This can allow an attacker to alter SQL statements passed to the database as parameters and enable her to not only steal data from your database, but also modify and delete it."
