These features include data abstraction, encapsulation, information hiding, polymorphism, and inheritance. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of both data and methods (behaviors) into a single entity called a class, which can be easily incorporated into different programs. A class defined in a C++ program is used to declare objects of that class type. Using the feature of encapsulation, the programmer can restrict access to components of the class, which is a key strength of encapsulation in C++. C++ classifies class members (data members and member methods) into one of three categories using access specifiers, which are also reserved words: private, public, and protected. Access specifiers determine the visibility or accessibility of an object's members, as specified in the table below:<br><br>"

When data is exposed, other components have complete access to that data and can cause mischief. Since RiskyTime allows all methods in the entire program direct access to its data members, an external method could set hour, minute, and second to an invalid time, such as 36:99:-33 (hour:minute:second).
