/**
 * Server-side script to handle interaction with clients.
 * 
 * Goals:
 * 		serve up images as requested by each module
 * 		serve up module JSON content, with appropriate CORS validation
 * 		update database with information from module completion
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 		port - which port to listen for requests on
 * 
 * Phase 2: extended significantly, and perhaps broken up over multiple files
 * 
 * NOTE: THERE is no phase 2 anymore per se. It is being folded into the CLARK
 * curriculum development application. Also, this comment is meaningless - it
 * is just a way to verify Eclipse GIT works. I'll delete the previous sentence
 * when I try out Visual Studio Code for comparison.
